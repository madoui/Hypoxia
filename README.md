# Data and code for "Hypoxia adaptation shapes genomic architecture and vertical niche transitions in copepods"
A friendly repository for those who need to acces data and code used in our study on the evolution of hypoxia tolerence in copepod.
1. "DE" directory is for the classification of genes overepressed in hypoxia
2. "proteomes" contains the fasta file of predicted proteomes of copepods
3. "KaKs_vs_copy_numer" contains the R script for the multivariates analysis
